//--Declaring Variables--

//Gas efficiency of the car
var gasEfficiency;
//Gauge reading of the gas tank (in %)
var gaugeReading;
//Car's gas tank capacity (in gallons)
var tankCapacity;

//--Assigning values to variables--

//Prompt for gas efficiency
gasEfficiency = prompt("What is your vehicle's average fuel efficiency (in mpg)?");
//Prompt for reading of gas tank
gaugeReading = prompt("What is the current reading of your fuel guage (in %?) \nExample: 90 is 90%.");
//Prompt for tank capacity
tankCapacity = prompt("What is your gas tank capacity (in gallons)?");
